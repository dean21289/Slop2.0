        <p>
          At <strong>SLOP Capital</strong>, we believe in chasing trends late,
          funding founders who look like us, and investing in the kind of
          "category-defining" startups that are mostly pitch decks and hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our founders, <strong>Sam Garcia</strong> and <strong>Jerry Ting</strong>,
          are proud to bring their combined experience in Law School GroupMe
          replies and late-night TweetDeck scrolling to help you raise a
          pre-seed round for your ChatGPT-powered Uber for CrossFit for Pets.
